## bash_functions

This folder has a script that was taken from my own .zshrc. There are two functions, one is for ros2 and the other one is for ros1. Adapt the script to your own needs. The last line of the file executes the ros2 function and everything related to ros2 will be loaded. You can remove this last line if you don't want to use ros2. You can directly call these functions in terminals instead of executing them from the script.
